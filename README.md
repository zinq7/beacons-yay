Holy Light (Beacons-yay) ~ By zinq
A mod that aims to either add a bunch of weapons and content that FITS being after everything else on the building line and does not look out of place // adds popular Supreme Commander (FA/2) units!

## Software Used
- **Visual Studio Code** : Editing all the files
- **Piskel** : Making sprites

---

## Mods that helped make this mod:

z0mbiesrock's Diamond Ore Mod (complex units and structures)
Eschatologue's Heavy Armaments Industries Mod (general modding startup)

Thank you so much! I'll give 90% of the credit to both those mods for helping me even start modding!

I hope you enjoy! I will probably delete this mod and merge all the separate peices in to some sort of Supreme Commander Mod, but y'never know what'll happen.
